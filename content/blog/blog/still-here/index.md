title: Still here
---

<p>Things have been pretty crazy the past few weeks. I've graduated, moved, gone on vacation, returned from vacation, interviewed for jobs, found a job, and started a job. Things are calming down now, and I may be able to write something useful here soon.</p>

<p>I plan on spending the summer refreshing my increasingly lacking programming abilities. I intended to do it with Python, but it sounds like Java will be a better investment for me, at least for now.</p>
