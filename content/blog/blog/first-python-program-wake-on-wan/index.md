title: First Python Program - Wake on Wan
---

So, I decided to start learning Python because I feel the need to get better at
programming and I was kinda tired of Java's bulkiness, especially when writing
simple things. For example, I decided that I wanted to write a script to wake my
home computer from the Internet. There are a bunch of programs out there for
Windows, but I couldn't find anything good for Mac. I also don't really like the
idea of using a web interface. So, I learned Python and built this [wake on LAN
script](https://gist.github.com/rschuetzler/8854764)


Magically, it works! I know it's nothing too special, but I felt cool.
