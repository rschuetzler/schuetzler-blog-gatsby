<p>As a student, my plate is always full. There are so many things I could be doing at any given time of the day. I fully believe that for the first part of my doctoral program I let that get the better of me. Since there was no way I would ever be finished with all the things I had to do, I often felt a reluctance to do much of anything. I met my deadlines, finished my homework, and even published a few conference papers. But with so much going on around me, and such an unlimited amount of potential work to complete, I was nailed down by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis paralysis</a>.</p>

<p>After reading several articles about it from <a href="https://lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a>, and hearing recommendations from one of my friends here, I finally broke down and bought a digital copy of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/David_Allen_Getting_Things_Done?id=iykLVJAK49kC&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImJvb2staXlrTFZKQUs0OWtDIl0.">Getting Things Done</a> This book and the GTD system have allowed me for the first time since I arrived at the University of Arizona to feel like I know what I need to get done and to have a plan to get there. I know, of course, that there is never really &quot;done&quot; in the life of an academic. Of course, there&#039;s not really &quot;done&quot; in any life. There are always more things to take on, more projects to complete.</p>

<p>I have tried to do lists in the past. I&#039;ve been through many. I&#039;ve tried productivity systems like Pomodoro, but to no avail. They helped me work, but I never really had a clear sense of <em>what</em> ****</p>
