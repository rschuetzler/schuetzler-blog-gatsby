title: Using Discourse.org for a class discussion board
---

For the past two semesters I have been using [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) for my class discussion board.  I started using it mainly due to the restricted nature of Canvas's built-in discussion boards, which are terribly designed for actual discussion.  Using Discourse, I'm able to have real conversations with my class, and my students are encouraged to interact with each other.

I recently gave a presentation at [UNO's Digital Learning Showcase](https://www.unomaha.edu/news/events/2019/05/2019-digital-learning-showcase.php) on how I use the discussion board in class to create a community and the many ways it's better at fostering engagement in my online classes compared to the kinda terrible built-in boards on Canvas. Check out my slides below.
