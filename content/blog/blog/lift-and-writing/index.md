title: Lift and Writing
---

<p>I got an invite to the web version of <a href="https://lift.do">Lift</a>, which is an amazingly simple application designed to help you get started and stick with daily habits. It is most beautiful in its simplicity. There is no failure. You simply stop by the website every day and check in with the habits you&#039;ve completed.</p>

<p>Inspired by recent posts on zenhabits.net and <a href="https://owened.co.nz/too-busy-consuming-to-create/">Svbtle</a>, I&#039;ve set a goal for myself to <a href="https://zenhabits.net/write-daily/">write every day</a>. I have no doubt that this will be a challenging expedition, but a rewarding one. Not everything I post will be published here. Some of it I&#039;m sure will be unfit to publish. Some days I&#039;ll spend my writing time working on research papers or proposals. But I really do hope that I can become a better writer simply by doing it more often.</p>

<p>So wish me luck as I begin this new journey. If you like, feel free to <a href="https://lift.do/users/7acee21af9eba5e51e2e">follow me on Lift</a>.</p>
