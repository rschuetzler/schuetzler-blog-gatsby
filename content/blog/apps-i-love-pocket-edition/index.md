title: Apps I love - Pocket edition

This is a ridiculous question, but have you ever found an article online that you wanted to read later? Bookmarks just don't seem to fit the bill for me in that situation. A bookmark is a commitment. It means I want to keep this site around for reference into forever. <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> (formerly ReadItLater) fits the bill perfectly here.

The beauty of Pocket is that it's everywhere. The Chrome extension lets you click a button in the browser and save a page to read later. The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5pZGVhc2hvd2VyLnJlYWRpdGxhdGVyLnBybyJd">Android</a> (or iOS) app lets you save articles from Twitter, the web browser, or a million other apps. It keeps all your saved articles in a queue that you can read either in the app or on the website.

Another beauty of Pocket that beats the heck out of bookmarks is the Archive. I have a record of all the articles that I have saved to read, but it's kept neatly out of sight. It also lets me tag articles so they can be all organized and stuff. I don't use that feature much, but I can see how it would be useful.

So pretty much, if you are the kind of person who reads a lot of stories and articles online, look into Pocket. It's the awesomesauce.
